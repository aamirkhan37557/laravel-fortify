we had scenario in case we wabt to filter or display data in menu bar

he had main menu or parent menu bar on which we click sub menu bar and child of sub menu bar open

he had uploaded the data and create foreign key constraint on them

steps

first we will create route but here we want to search on slug we want the slug like

product/parentmenu/submenu     and display all the data sub child data 

Route::get('/product/{categorySlug}/{subcategorySlug}', 'api\getcat@findBasedOnSubcategory');

now create a controller and function or it

for debugging purpose 

//here Request $request is general thing
//$categorySlug is the parameter passed in the router so we need it here also 
//SubCategory $subcategorySlug   we need to dislay data from subcategory so for that we need its model 


                public function findBasedOnSubcategory(Request $request,$categorySlug , SubCategory $subcategorySlug){

                                              return 'hi';
                                                         }
                                                         
as by default primary key is use for seraching but here we want slug as primary key for that we need to include the following function
in subcategory model 
                                 public function getRouteKeyName()
    { 
                        return 'slug';
    }
    
    //now go to url and check it but note {categorySlug}/{subcategorySlug} must be db which you want to pass in url 
    
   
   as sub menu had many child sub menu so for that
   
   
   public function ads()
   {
       return $this->hasMany(Advertisement::class);
   }


  public function findBasedOnSubcategory(Request $request,$categorySlug , SubCategory $subcategorySlug){

$ads=$subcategorySlug->ads;
         return $ads
           }
   now display it in loop
