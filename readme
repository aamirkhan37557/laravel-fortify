laravel fortify does not use bootstrap we had to configure it manually 

                                     composer require laravel/fortify
publish its vendor

      php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Laravel\Fortify\FortifyServiceProvider"

                                    php artisan migrate
            
 this ha s created foritfy file in app directory /action/fortify which had all the file you need for your registering stuff  
 note fortify does not any views for login and register etc so we can use it with laravel jet stream and sanctum to gain that view or we 
 can create the views forregisteration by our own for that we had two option first is to app fority service and in boot section create the view to register
 route or we can to it in web.php and App\Providers\FortifyServiceProvider in boot route the reigiter same as web.php
           
                                           use Laravel\Fortify\Fortify;
                                           //fortify routes   by defalut its routes is register for get and post 
                                           Fortify::registerView(function () {
                                    return view('register');
                                });



note the route for registering or creating new user is route register

                             <form action="{{route('register')}}" method="post">@csrf
       
       as it is redirecting to home so we will create view fr home or we will create another view and redirect to that view from 
       
       after a successfully registertion it will automaticall redirected to home route so create a route for homme

                                       Route::get('home', function () {
                                    return view('home');
                                });
                                
for printing name in home page and logout

                                  name:
                                {{auth()->user()->name}}

logout code

                          <a href="{{ route('logout') }}" onclick="event.preventDefault(); document.getElementById('logout-form').submit();">
                              Logout
                          </a>

                          <form id="logout-form" action="{{ route('logout') }}" method="POST">
                              @csrf
                          </form>

now for login  use login route login file is attached with it 


now email verfication

After registration, you may wish for users to verify their email address before they continue accessing your application

create a dashboard route and controller for it 

and in 
              route::get('dashboard','dashboardcontroller@index');
              
                      verified is from kernel.php which is predefined
            public function __construct(){
        return $this->middleware(['auth','verified']);
            }
            
            in user model 
            
        class User extends Authenticatable implements MustVerifyEmail{
        
        and in config /fortify enable email varification features
        
        
        do mail trap .io configatraion and verify-email .blade.php this will refresh the link
        v  <form  action="{{ route('verification.send') }}" method="POST">
                              @csrf
<input type="submit" name="verify">

                          </form>


              password reset
